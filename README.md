# primitive-default-value-go

The primitive-default-value-go package is designed to facilitate the customization of default values for primitive types during code generation processes. It is specifically aimed at scenarios where developers need to modify the default initialization values of primitive data types in their generated code. As such, all return values from this package are in string format.

This tool may not directly suit application-side implementations without some adjustments, as its primary function is to aid in the code generation phase rather than serve as an application-level utility.
## Features

- Custom default value setting for primitive types during code generation.
- All return values are provided as strings for seamless integration into generated code.

## Usage

This package is particularly useful for developers working on code generation tools or frameworks that require specific default values for data types beyond the Go language's built-in defaults.
